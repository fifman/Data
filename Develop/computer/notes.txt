data sink：计算技术语，任何能接受data的媒介。

In computing, a sink, event sink or data sink is a class or function designed to receive incoming events from another object or function. This is commonly implemented in C++ as callbacks. Other Object-oriented languages, such as Java and C#, have built-in support for sinks by allowing events to be fired to delegate functions.

Due to lack of formal definition, a sink is often misconstrued with a gateway which is a similar construct but the latter is usually either an end-point or allows bi-direction communication between dissimilar systems, as opposed to just an event input point[citation needed]. This is often seen in C++ and hardware-related programming[citation needed], thus the choice of nomenclature by a developer usually depends on whether the agent acting on a sink is a producer or consumer of the sink content.

The word sink has been used for both input and output in the industry. Mobile sink is proposed to save sensor energy for multihop communication in transferring data to a base station (sink) in wireless sensor networks.

provisioning：对应用的设置、预置，Provisioning is a term most often used in the telecommunication field. In this capacity, it refers to the configuration of both hardware and software in order to activate telecommunication service for a customer. Provisioning is not equipment. Rather, it consists of commands and controls for specific telecommunication devices.
　　The configuration process of provisioning allows the user to access data and technology remotely. The user also has the ability to look up secured data and to grant authorization to a wide range of network applications and databases by utilizing a unique identity process. Provisioning is generally managed and incorporated into departments such as information Technology (IT) and human resources. It gives network administrators the ability to assign technology privileges to employees and contractors of companies, as well to business partners. The software can also be used by a company’s IT department in order to enforce maximum security of system resources.
　　Provisioning also assists in monitoring the protection process of access privileges. This security feature is widely used along with hardware resources in products such as computers, pagers, and mobile phones in order to increase security and privacy. With its unique boot image control, provisioning reduces the number of configurations utilized during the transfer of information and, as a result, decreases the amount of abuse to the system.

Onboarding: also known as organizational socialization, refers to the mechanism through which new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become effective organizational members and insiders.
